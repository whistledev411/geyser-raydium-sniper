# Raydium Sniper(Yellowstone gRPC)

You can snipe and trade tokens on raydium with geyser.

I updated monitoring method from onLogs method to webHook method, so you can use Geyser rpc for monitoring(Helius Business version is also fine).

## How efficient rather than before?
It reduced monitoring time of new token, from 1s to 0.1~0.2s.
